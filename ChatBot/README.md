# F# Chatbot with OpenAI's ChatGPT API

## Overview

The F# Chatbot is a console application that integrates with OpenAI's ChatGPT API to provide interactive conversational capabilities. It demonstrates how to leverage F# for asynchronous programming, HTTP client integration, and handling API responses.

## Features

- **Asynchronous API Calls:** Uses F# asynchronous workflows to handle non-blocking HTTP requests.
- **Retry Logic:** Implements a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for robust error handling.
- **ChatGPT Integration:** Connects to OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate responses based on user input.
- **Interactive Console Interface:** Provides a command-line interface where users can chat with the bot.

## Key Features and Skills

1. **F# Programming Language Basics**
   - Learn the fundamentals of F# syntax and functional programming paradigms.
   - Understand how to define and use functions, handle data types, and manage sequences.

2. **Asynchronous Programming**
   - Utilize F#â€™s `async` workflows for non-blocking operations.
   - Learn to convert between .NET `Task` and F# `Async`.

3. **HTTP Client Integration**
   - Make HTTP POST requests using `HttpClient` to interact with REST APIs.
   - Handle API responses and parse JSON data.

4. **Retry Logic**
   - Implement error handling with retry strategies for transient errors.
   - Use exponential backoff to manage retry delays.

5. **Console I/O Operations**
   - Build an interactive command-line application.
   - Handle user input and output responses in a console environment.

6. **API Integration**
   - Understand how to authenticate and interact with external APIs.
   - Manage API keys and handle different response scenarios.

7. **Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling to manage API errors and network issues.
   - Validate and clean data before processing.

8. **Project Setup and Configuration**
   - Set up and configure an F# project in Visual Studio.
   - Manage NuGet packages and project references.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [F# Compiler and Tools](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- An API key from OpenAI

### Installation

1. **Create a New F# Project in Visual Studio**

   - Open Visual Studio.
   - Go to **File > New > Project**.
   - Select **F#** from the language dropdown.
   - Choose **Console App (.NET Core)** or **Console App (.NET 8)** from the project templates.
   - Click **Next**.

2. **Configure Your Project**

   - Enter a name for your project (e.g., `FSharpChatbot`).
   - Choose a location for your project files.
   - Click **Create**.

3. **Add Required Packages**

   - Open the NuGet Package Manager:
     - Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer.
     - Select **Manage NuGet Packages**.
   - Search for and install the following packages:
     - `Newtonsoft.Json` (for JSON handling)
     - `System.Net.Http` (for HTTP client operations)

### Configuration

Replace the placeholder `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` in the `getChatGPTResponse` function with your actual API key from OpenAI:

```fsharp
let apiKey = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
